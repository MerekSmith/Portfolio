            I am a full stack web developer with a background in Supply Chain
            and Finance. I recently graduated the Coding Bootcamp from the
            University of Utah in July 2018. I primarily learned and use the
            MERN stack and am currently working to continue my education in web
            development. I am taking several more online courses to further my
            knowledge, with a focus on React and Redux. I am currently working
            as a Supply Chain Analyst with Overstock.com but am pursuing a
            career change into Web Development. I am a quick learner with a
            strong work ethic and constantly strive to learn more and progress.

      <p>
        When I am not working on web development, I love to spend time with my
        family. My newly found, favorite hobby is playing board games. I have
        over 100 unique, modern board games. Part of my collection includes
        games that my 5 year old daughter can play but are still very
        interesting for adults. They can often be very educational as well. I
        find games to be very stimulating as I love to think and be strategic. I
        am also a geek at heart and love superheroes, especially Marvel movies,
        as well as video games.
